		CHANGES IN fdrtool VERSION 1.1.0

This version contains some major new functionality.  In particular, it 
now offers functions to estimate both tail area based Fdr as well as 
density based fdr values for various kind of null models:

New functions:
- fdrtool:       the central function for computing fdr/Fdr values.
- censored.fit:  learn null model from censored sample
- monoreg:       isotonic and antitonic regression with weights
- gcmlcm:        find greatest convex minorant and least concave majorant
- grenander:     non-parametric estimate of concave CDF and decreasing density
- halfnormal:    functions for half-normal distribution
- dcor0:         distribution of vanishing correlation coefficient

Removed functions:
- fdr.estimate.eta0:   was replaced by pval.estimate.eta()
- fdr.control:         the function fdrtool() should be used.
- density.pr:          not needed any more

Other:
- dependency on locfdr package removed
- fdrtool now requires R 2.2.1



		CHANGES IN fdrtool VERSION 1.0.0
