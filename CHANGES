                CHANGES IN fdrtool VERSION 1.1.2

- fdrtool() now has "dots" as option to allow the specification
  of arguments for the locfdr function


                CHANGES IN fdrtool VERSION 1.1.1


- the default behaviour of censored.fit() has been changed
  such that for multiple pct0 (i.e. length(pct0) > 1) the scale 
  parameter is estimated for each element of pct0, subsequently 
  a smoothing spline is computed, and finally the optimal parameter 
  is taken as the minimum of the spline smoother.
- new "verbose" option in fdrtool()
- new "diagnostic.plot" option in censored.fit()
- option to rely on locfdr >= 1.1-4 for fitting null distribution
  of correlation and normal scores



		CHANGES IN fdrtool VERSION 1.1.0

This version contains some major new functionality.  In particular, it 
now offers functions to estimate both tail area based Fdr as well as 
density based fdr values for various kind of null models:

New functions:
- fdrtool:       the central function for computing fdr/Fdr values.
- censored.fit:  learn null model from censored sample
- monoreg:       isotonic and antitonic regression with weights
- gcmlcm:        find greatest convex minorant and least concave majorant
- grenander:     non-parametric estimate of concave CDF and decreasing density
- halfnormal:    functions for half-normal distribution
- dcor0:         distribution of vanishing correlation coefficient

Removed functions:
- fdr.estimate.eta0:   was replaced by pval.estimate.eta()
- fdr.control:         the function fdrtool() should be used.
- density.pr:          not needed any more

Other:
- dependency on locfdr package removed
- fdrtool now requires R 2.2.1



		CHANGES IN fdrtool VERSION 1.0.0


This is the first standalone release (9 August 2006).
Previously, the functions available in this package were part of
the GeneTS package (version 2.10.2)
